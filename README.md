In all honesty i found this task to be very challenging, with the amount of time i had on my hands i should have developed a better chatbot. At first i had difficulty understanding spacy and found it a bit challenging to implement spacy the way in which you intendend so i decided to go about it my own way by try to the get the program to calculate which response might be probabible so if your question is not a question that was specified to the bot the bot is going to have a hard time responding to your question and i struggled in getting the bot to send the location of the bakery when required.
I would really like tto get your feedback and ways in which i could improve thank you
